  abstract = {Dr. Donovan will provide a summary of her lab’s ongoing research investigations into changes in large ({$>$}200 ha) wildfire activity across multiple scales in the eastern U.S. and the interacting factors affecting wildfire risk. Specifically, we found shifting wildfire regime characteristics across south and central ecoregions in the east that include increasing wildfire number, size, and annual occurrence, along with changes in wildfire seasonality.  Just under half of all wildfires burned within the wildland-urban interface (WUI), where the greatest risk to human life and property from wildfires exists. Increases in large wildfire are largely occurring outside the WUI, though these wildfires tend to be closer to the WUI than expected at random. We find factors such as suppression potential, weather conditions, and patterns in woody cover influence the WUI-wildfire dynamic, but relationships vary regionally. We also identified long-term increases in woody cover across eastern ecoregions, linking higher levels of woody cover to heightened wildfire risk in multiple locations. Further investigations have found that woody cover interactions with short-term drought strongly predict large wildfire occurrence across numerous eastern ecoregions. While further research into the drivers of changing large wildfire patterns is needed, we suggest the strategic application of fuels management along with the development of fire-resistant homes and buildings to enhance community resilience to wildfire in the east.}

Increases in fuel loads from woody encroachment and canopy infilling have been associated with increasing wildfire risk in other US regions. Understanding if and where woody cover increases wildfire risk can help direct proactive fuels management. We characterize multi-scale changes in woody cover through time and assess the relationship between woody cover and large wildfire ({$>$}200 ha) occurrence in the eastern US between 1990 and 2020. We found a 37\% increase in woody cover across the eastern US, with increases occurring in every ecoregion. The odds of large wildfire increased as woody cover increased in most central and southern ecoregions, where large wildfires were typically more likely in areas with high woody cover (70\%–100\% cover). Our findings suggest fuels management will be an important tool for reducing large wildfire risk.},

  abstract = {Woody cover increases in historically open ecosystems are occurring across the globe, leading to ecosystem degradation and increased wildfire risk. Tree and shrub cover is increasing in the eastern United States, which historically was dominated by open forest ecosystems; however, it is still unclear whether recent woody cover increases are due to infilling, linked to ecosystem degradation due to fire suppression, or to land use changes such as conversion of croplands to commercial pine plantations. Understanding the nature of recent woody cover increases is essential for identifying and addressing potential risks to ecosystem function and human activities. Using remotely sensed data, we quantified woody cover changes from 2001 to 2021 across land use types and compared the relative contribution of infilling and land-use conversion to increasing woody cover trends. We found that although overall forest cover had decreased, remaining forests became denser, especially deciduous forests. This infilling contributed the majority of increasing woody cover on the landscape. However, the conversion of non-forested land-cover types to evergreen forests was also a significant contributor to increasing woody cover on the landscape, especially in the southern half of the region. Our findings suggest that forest infilling is the greatest contributor to increasing woody cover in the eastern U.S., suggesting the continued degradation of fire-dependent open forests in the eastern U.S.}

  abstract = {Wildfires are increasing in the eastern United States. The wildland-urban interface (WUI), which occurs at the intersection between human development and wildland vegetative fuels, remains the focus for predicting and mitigating wildfire risk. Wildfires in the WUI require more resources to suppress, destroy more homes, and pose a greater threat to human life. The eastern U.S. contains a disproportionately large amount of the WUI compared to other parts of the country, making it crucial to characterize differences between WUI and non-WUI wildfire regime changes. We contrast spatial and temporal characteristics of WUI versus non-WUI wildfire regimes across Level III ecoregions in the eastern U.S. using decadal WUI maps from 1990 to 2020 combined with large wildfire perimeter data and ignition source data from 1986 to 2021. We found that a substantial proportion of wildfires occurred in the WUI (45\%), even though the WUI only makes up 22\% of the eastern U.S. by area. The number of wildfires, mean area burned, and total area burned increased both inside and outside the WUI in most ecoregions. The primary source of wildfire ignitions in the WUI was arson and, secondarily, natural causes (lightning). The results of this study highlight the increasing risk of large wildfires in the eastern U.S. and can be used to help support informed decision-making surrounding wildfire risk management in the region.}

Overall, wildfires in the WUI burned in areas with higher woody cover, more suppression resources nearby, higher road density, lower precipitation, lower wind speed and during times when suppression resources were more strained than wildfires outside the WUI.

In the East, thewildland-urban interface (WUI), where wildfire risk is greatest, has expanded tremendously over the last three decades. In this thesis, we aimed to understand how increasing large wildfires in the East are manifesting in the WUI. Using large (≥200 ha) wildfire perimeters, we (1) assessed WUI growth and its relationship with large wildfire regime characteristics and (2) determined the spatial WUI-wildfire relationships and the social and environmental factors driving these patterns over the last three decades in the eastern US at multiple spatial scales. While the WUI only makes up 22\% of the East, WUI wildfires comprised 45\% of all large wildfires and 55\% of the area burned, were on average 46\% larger than non-WUI wildfires, and are becoming more frequent in spring. Most increases in wildfire activity occurred outside of the WUI. Additionally, large wildfires burn less often in the WUI and less of the WUI than expected at random; however, wildfires that burn outside of the WUI burn closer to the WUI than expected. Environmental factors and, to a lesser extent, social variables are important for predicting these WUI-wildfire relationships. Higher levels of woody cover, drier conditions, and strained federal suppression resources drove wildfire occurrence in and near the WUI. Our findings highlight important interactions between human development and large wildfire occurrence and the need for proactive fuelsmanagement in the East.}
