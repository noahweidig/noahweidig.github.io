abstract: Woody cover increases in historically open ecosystems are occurring across
  the globe, leading to ecosystem degradation and increased wildfire risk. Tree and
  shrub cover is increasing in the eastern United States, which historically was dominated
  by open forest ecosystems; however, it is still unclear whether recent woody cover
  increases are due to infilling, linked to ecosystem degradation due to fire suppression,
  or to land use changes such as conversion of croplands to commercial pine plantations.
  Understanding the nature of recent woody cover increases is essential for identifying
  and addressing potential risks to ecosystem function and human activities. Using
  remotely sensed data, we quantified woody cover changes from 2001 to 2021 across
  land use types and compared the relative contribution of infilling and land-use
  conversion to increasing woody cover trends. We found that although overall forest
  cover had decreased, remaining forests became denser, especially deciduous forests.
  This infilling contributed the majority of increasing woody cover on the landscape.
  However, the conversion of non-forested land-cover types to evergreen forests was
  also a significant contributor to increasing woody cover on the landscape, especially
  in the southern half of the region. Our findings suggest that forest infilling is
  the greatest contributor to increasing woody cover in the eastern U.S., suggesting
  the continued degradation of fire-dependent open forests in the eastern U.S.
