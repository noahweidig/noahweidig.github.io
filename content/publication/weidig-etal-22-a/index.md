abstract: Females of container-breeding mosquito species use visual and chemical cues
  to determine suitable habitats to oviposit their eggs. Female Culex mosquitoes oviposit
  single egg rafts containing hundreds of eggs on the surface of water in container
  habitats. In this project, the effects of water volume and nutrient concentration
  were studied using three semi-controlled field assays to determine the role these
  parameters play on female Culex mosquito oviposition preference. The results of
  this study suggest female Culex prefer to oviposit in larger volumes of water and
  higher concentrations of nutrients separately, but chose intermediate conditions
  when presented with a combination of these two variables, which follows the Goldilocks
  principle. This choice may provide their offspring with optimal conditions for development
  by reducing intraspecific competition, thereby maximizing the biological fitness
  of the ovipositing Culex females.
