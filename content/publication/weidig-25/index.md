abstract: The recent increase in large wildfires in the eastern United States makes
  it crucial to examine the subsequent risk to human life and property. In the East,
  thewildland-urban interface (WUI), where wildfire risk is greatest, has expanded
  tremendously over the last three decades. In this thesis, we aimed to understand
  how increasing large wildfires in the East are manifesting in the WUI. Using large
  (â‰¥200 ha) wildfire perimeters, we (1) assessed WUI growth and its relationship with
  large wildfire regime characteristics and (2) determined the spatial WUI-wildfire
  relationships and the social and environmental factors driving these patterns over
  the last three decades in the eastern US at multiple spatial scales. While the WUI
  only makes up 22% of the East, WUI wildfires comprised 45% of all large wildfires
  and 55% of the area burned, were on average 46% larger than non-WUI wildfires, and
  are becoming more frequent in spring. Most increases in wildfire activity occurred
  outside of the WUI. Additionally, large wildfires burn less often in the WUI and
  less of the WUI than expected at random; however, wildfires that burn outside of
  the WUI burn closer to the WUI than expected. Environmental factors and, to a lesser
  extent, social variables are important for predicting these WUI-wildfire relationships.
  Higher levels of woody cover, drier conditions, and strained federal suppression
  resources drove wildfire occurrence in and near the WUI. Our findings highlight
  important interactions between human development and large wildfire occurrence and
  the need for proactive fuelsmanagement in the East.
