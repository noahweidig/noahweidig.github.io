abstract: 'The recent increase in large wildfires in the eastern United States makes
  it crucial to examine the subsequent risk to human life and property. In the eastern
  US, the wildland–urban interface (WUI), where wildfire risk is greatest, has expanded
  tremendously over the last three decades. Aims: This study aimed to understand how
  increasing wildfires in the eastern US are manifesting in the WUI. We quantified
  WUI growth and characterised large ($>$200~ha) wildfire regimes inside and outside
  the WUI at multiple spatial scales across the eastern US between 1986 and 2021.
  WUI wildfires in the eastern US comprised 45% of all large wildfires and 55% of
  the area burned, were on average 46% larger than non-WUI wildfires, and are becoming
  more frequent in spring. Most increases in wildfire number and area burned occurred
  outside of the WUI. The WUI plays an important role in large wildfire dynamics in
  the eastern US; however, increases in the number of large wildfires have occurred
  primarily outside the WUI. Our findings highlight important interactions between
  human development and large wildfire occurrence in the eastern US and should be
  used to direct future region-specific assessments of changing wildfire risk.'
