abstract: Large wildfires are increasing in the eastern U.S., which contains the greatest
  amount of WUI compared to the rest of the country. Wildfires in and near the WUI
  pose the greatest risk to human life and property. However, the spatial relationship
  between large wildfires and the WUI in the eastern U.S., as well as which factors
  drive these patterns, remains unclear. Using large wildfire ($>$200 ha) data from
  1991 and 2021, we (1) assessed the spatial relationships of large wildfires relative
  to the WUI and (2) modeled these relationships using a variety of social and environmental
  variables at multiple spatial scales. Specifically, we assessed wildfire WUI status
  (intersecting or outside the WUI), distance to WUI, and proportion of WUI area burned.
  We found that fewer wildfires burned in the WUI compared to a random distribution.
  Wildfires that intersected the WUI burned either a very small or very large proportion
  of the WUI; however, wildfires outside the WUI burned closer to it than expected
  at random. At the largest spatial scale, our global model containing weather, fuel,
  ignition, and suppression-related variables best explained the relationship between
  wildfires and the WUI. Overall, wildfires in the WUI burned in areas with higher
  woody cover, more suppression resources nearby, higher road density, lower precipitation,
  lower wind speed and during times when suppression resources were more strained
  than wildfires outside the WUI. Wildfires that burned a larger proportion of the
  WUI or burned closer to the WUI experienced similar trends compared to wildfires
  that burned a smaller proportion of the WUI or burned farther from the WUI. At the
  regional scale, factors driving these relationships varied among eastern ecoregions.
  Our findings highlight the need for region-specific wildfire risk management and
  improved fire suppression planning.
