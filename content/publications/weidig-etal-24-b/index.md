abstract: Wildfires are increasing in the eastern United States. The wildland-urban
  interface (WUI), which occurs at the intersection between human development and
  wildland vegetative fuels, remains the focus for predicting and mitigating wildfire
  risk. Wildfires in the WUI require more resources to suppress, destroy more homes,
  and pose a greater threat to human life. The eastern U.S. contains a disproportionately
  large amount of the WUI compared to other parts of the country, making it crucial
  to characterize differences between WUI and non-WUI wildfire regime changes. We
  contrast spatial and temporal characteristics of WUI versus non-WUI wildfire regimes
  across Level III ecoregions in the eastern U.S. using decadal WUI maps from 1990
  to 2020 combined with large wildfire perimeter data and ignition source data from
  1986 to 2021. We found that a substantial proportion of wildfires occurred in the
  WUI (45%), even though the WUI only makes up 22% of the eastern U.S. by area. The
  number of wildfires, mean area burned, and total area burned increased both inside
  and outside the WUI in most ecoregions. The primary source of wildfire ignitions
  in the WUI was arson and, secondarily, natural causes (lightning). The results of
  this study highlight the increasing risk of large wildfires in the eastern U.S.
  and can be used to help support informed decision-making surrounding wildfire risk
  management in the region.
