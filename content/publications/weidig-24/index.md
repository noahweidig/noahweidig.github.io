abstract: This talk covers the fundamentals of using R Markdown to create reproducible
  workflows that seamlessly integrate code, results, and narrative. It will demonstrate
  how R Markdown enables efficient documentation and sharing of data analyses by combining
  R code with formatted text in a single document. Key topics include setting up R
  Markdown files, organizing content with chunks, generating dynamic reports in various
  formats, and best practices for maintaining reproducibility and clarity in data
  science projects.
