abstract: Large wildfires are increasing in the eastern United States; however, what
  factors are heightening large wildfire risk remains unclear. Increases in fuel loads
  from woody encroachment and canopy infilling have been associated with increasing
  wildfire risk in other US regions. Understanding if and where woody cover increases
  wildfire risk can help direct proactive fuels management. We characterize multi-scale
  changes in woody cover through time and assess the relationship between woody cover
  and large wildfire ($>$200 ha) occurrence in the eastern US between 1990 and 2020.
  We found a 37% increase in woody cover across the eastern US, with increases occurring
  in every ecoregion. The odds of large wildfire increased as woody cover increased
  in most central and southern ecoregions, where large wildfires were typically more
  likely in areas with high woody cover (70%â€“100% cover). Our findings suggest fuels
  management will be an important tool for reducing large wildfire risk.
