abstract: Dr. Donovan will provide a summary of her labâ€™s ongoing research investigations
  into changes in large ($>$200 ha) wildfire activity across multiple scales in the
  eastern U.S. and the interacting factors affecting wildfire risk. Specifically,
  we found shifting wildfire regime characteristics across south and central ecoregions
  in the east that include increasing wildfire number, size, and annual occurrence,
  along with changes in wildfire seasonality.  Just under half of all wildfires burned
  within the wildland-urban interface (WUI), where the greatest risk to human life
  and property from wildfires exists. Increases in large wildfire are largely occurring
  outside the WUI, though these wildfires tend to be closer to the WUI than expected
  at random. We find factors such as suppression potential, weather conditions, and
  patterns in woody cover influence the WUI-wildfire dynamic, but relationships vary
  regionally. We also identified long-term increases in woody cover across eastern
  ecoregions, linking higher levels of woody cover to heightened wildfire risk in
  multiple locations. Further investigations have found that woody cover interactions
  with short-term drought strongly predict large wildfire occurrence across numerous
  eastern ecoregions. While further research into the drivers of changing large wildfire
  patterns is needed, we suggest the strategic application of fuels management along
  with the development of fire-resistant homes and buildings to enhance community
  resilience to wildfire in the east.
