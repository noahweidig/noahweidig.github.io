abstract: Wildfire risk is changing across the globe. We provide a summary of ongoing
  investigations into changes in large ($>$200 ha) wildfire activity across multiple
  scales in the eastern U.S. and the interacting factors affecting wildfire risk.
  We found shifting wildfire regime characteristics across south and central ecoregions
  in the east that include increasing wildfire number, size, and annual occurrence,
  along with changes in wildfire seasonality. Human ignitions started most wildfires
  in the eastern U.S., though in the Southern Coastal Plain, the majority of area
  burned was caused by naturally started wildfires. Just under half of all wildfires
  burned within the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI), where the greatest risk to human
  life and property from wildfires exists. However, increasing trends in large wildfire
  are largely occurring outside the WUI. We find factors such as suppression potential,
  weather conditions, and fuels influence this dynamic. We also identified long-term
  increases in woody cover across eastern ecoregions, linking higher levels of woody
  cover to heightened wildfire risk in multiple locations. Further investigations
  find that climate-woody cover interactions strongly predict large wildfire occurrence
  across numerous eastern ecoregions. While further research into the drivers of changing
  large wildfire patterns is needed, we suggest the strategic application of fuels
  management along with the development of fire-resistant homes and buildings to enhance
  community resilience to wildfire.
